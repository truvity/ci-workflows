# caller-parity's comparison, exercised against a stub API.
#
# The check compares SUBSTANCE, and both ways of being wrong are quiet:
# too strict and every repository differs over its own prose, until the
# table is noise nobody reads; too loose and it reports parity over a
# repository that has lost a trigger — which is the defect the check
# exists to catch. So the exemptions are pinned here, each as a case
# built by transforming the real canonical copy: a repository that
# rewrote the comments, one that staggered its cron, one whose library
# pin renovate has not moved yet, one that dropped a trigger, two that
# ADDED something the kit does not have, one that does not carry the
# file at all, and reads that fail.
#
# The two "added" cases were measured, not imagined. Every case here
# until 2026-09-21 removed or rewrote something, because the public
# estate's callers are the kit. Enrolling private repositories put the
# other direction on the table: a caller that carries the kit plus its
# own `with:` inputs (a runner pool, a module proxy) and one that
# carries the kit plus a top-level block and a renamed job. Both must
# read `differs` — a comparison that only notices deletions would call
# either one parity.
#
# The action's `api-url` input exists for exactly this: the stub answers
# on localhost and caller-parity.sh cannot tell the difference.
