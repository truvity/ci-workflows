# What `setup-devbox` does about caches, now that it does not do the caching.
#
# The wiring moved to truvity/ci-cache's own `setup` action, which is tested
# there by executing its step bodies (hack/setup-cases.sh, 21 cases). What
# stays here is the SEAM: that this composite delegates, that it hands over
# every input the cache needs, that the retired input is not silently
# ignored, and that the one local step still runs.
#
# The seam is worth its own cases because it is where the two repositories
# can disagree without either being wrong on its own -- an input added there
# and not passed here is a cache that quietly does less, which is exactly
# the failure mode this whole line of work was chasing.
